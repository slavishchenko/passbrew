## Usage

Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the Password Generator module to create passwords and passphrases:

```python
from password import UserFriendlyPassword, Passphrase

# Create an instance of UserFriendlyPassword
friendly_password_generator = UserFriendlyPassword()

# Generate a user-friendly password of length 16
password = friendly_password_generator.generate(length=16)
print("Generated User-Friendly Password:", password)

# Create an instance of Passphrase
passphrase_generator = Passphrase()

# Generate a passphrase of length 20 (characters)
passphrase = passphrase_generator.generate(password_length=20)
print("Generated Passphrase:", passphrase)
```

## API Reference

### Classes
